# Contribution Guidelines

We welcome all developers to contribute to our extension! Your efforts are truly appreciated. To ensure smooth collaboration, please keep the following points in mind before submitting your pull requests:

## 1. Add Only Relevant Code
- Avoid unnecessary modifications to existing code, including formatting changes.  
- Refrain from using options like "Format Document" in editors like VS Code, as these changes make it difficult to review the actual modifications.

## 2. Provide Visual Context
- Always attach a screenshot or screen recording of your changes in action.  
- Include a detailed description of the changes and their purpose in the pull request.

## 3. Follow Code Style Guidelines
- Stick to the existing coding style and structure of the project.  
- Use consistent indentation and naming conventions.

## 4. Avoid Adding Unnecessary Dependencies
- Before adding any library or dependency, explain its purpose and confirm that it's essential for the functionality you're implementing.

## 5. Test Thoroughly
- Ensure that your changes are fully functional and do not introduce any bugs or performance issues.  
- Test your code on various screen sizes and scenarios if applicable.

## 6. Test Across Browsers
- Test your code in both **Chrome** and **Firefox** to ensure compatibility and that everything is working properly.

## 7. Keep Pull Requests Focused
- Focus on one feature or fix per pull request. Avoid bundling unrelated changes together.

## 8. Document Changes
- If your changes introduce new functionality, update any relevant documentation or provide notes for other contributors.

By following these guidelines, we can maintain a clean and efficient codebase while making the review process faster and easier for everyone. Thank you for your contributions and for helping improve this project!
